Answers to technical questions
==================================

1. *How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.*

I spent about an hour on the technical test. If I had more time I would probably add dependency injection and parallelisation of features, in addition to more test cases. It would be interesting to add failure scenarios (especially if I could have control over the test data). For example, searching for a type of food that isn't sold in a particular area, searching in an invalid postcode, or filtering for a restaurant that doesn't exist.

2. *What do you think is the most intresting trend in test automation?*

The trend that most interests me lately is continuous delivery, and the breaking down of walls between developers, testers and ops people. The skills cross-pollination is especially interesting and makes us all better engineers. Additionally, the improved communication between functions and the reduced risk that comes with build / test / deployment automation makes working a lot less stressful.
3. *How would you implement test automation in a a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?*

I have done it. My approach was a top-down one. I started by automating the highest-value user journeys from an end-to-end perspective and gradually worked my way down the test automation pyramid as time permitted.

4. *How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?*

I would make it easier to filter out restaurants / dishes for people with special dietary requirements. For example, I would create a filter for vegan or gluten-free food and have it under the restaurant name or cuisine type filter.

Another thing I would do would be to add a search-box filter to the cuisine type filter. It is a bit long at the moment and would save time scrolling down.
